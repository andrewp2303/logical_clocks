## Overview

We implemented a socket-based model that tests Lamport logical clocks! See template.pdf for our writeup, and 
  below for running instructions.


## Setup

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/). We have a list of requirements which you can find in the requirements.txt file. To install these requirements, run the following in your command line: 

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

Simply run the following command at the command line, and the results will be output into a set of .txt files containing logs, logical clock times, and queue sizes for each of the machines in the trial!
